# 🎼 Wolfie: AI-Powered Mood-Based Music Generator

**Wolfie** is an original AI system designed to generate emotionally expressive music based on mood input — combining symbolic harmony logic, classical music theory, and modern Python-based audio tools.

This project interprets emotional cues and generates chord progressions and melodies in the style of classical composers like Bach and Beethoven — with room to grow into generative deep learning.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is still in development. Core music generation and rule-based harmony logic are functional; LSTM and transformer-based melody extensions are in progress.

- 🧠 Melody generation based on symbolic AI and classical rules
- 🎹 Output in MIDI format using `pretty_midi` and `FluidSynth`
- ⚙️ Customizable parameters: scale mode, cadence type, inversion behavior, tempo
